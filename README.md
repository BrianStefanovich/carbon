# carbonized-typography

This is of my own interpretation of the grid layout and font styles proposed by carbon design system. The main difference is that is based on Montserrat and Open Sans rather than Plex font face.

## Instalation

1. Run ```npm install carbonized-typography```
2. On your sass file ```@import "carbonized-typograpy/carbonized.scss"```

## Use

You've got access to type tokens ([info here](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/typography/overview)), and to grid tokens ([info here](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/2x-grid/implementation)).
